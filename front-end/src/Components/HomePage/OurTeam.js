I began my career as a Full-Stack Developer because of an Alumni Fellow who recognized those same qualities in web-development. I currently work as an Educator and Supervisor training others to optimally support and communicate with Middle School students  and though I love it, Pursuit has broken the ceiling as I pursue self development.",
