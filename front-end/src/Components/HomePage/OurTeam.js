I began my career as a Full-Stack Developer because of an Alumni Fellow who recognized those same qualities in web-development.

I currently work as a storage manager. I began my journey as a full stack web-development with pursuit which has been a great experience with the skills I have acquired, which I will use in helping solve world problems through tech.",
